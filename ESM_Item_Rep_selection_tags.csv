As recommended by Eckenrode (1984), the 12 events that were coded in one of the personal health categories were excluded from the analysis to avoid possible confounding with the mood outcome measures. The analysis differentiated between work versus other (i.e., nonwork) events only. Event descriptions were also scored according to whether or not they explicitly mentioned a stressful social interaction or a task demand (t.g., overloads, deadlines)","","",2404,"substance use"
